       <h1> Ingredients</h1>
       <h2>Cake</h2>
       <li>3 cups white sugar
        <li>1 ½ cups butter</li>
      <li>  5 large eggs</li>
      <li>  3 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>  ½ teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
       <li> 1 ¼ cups whole milk</li>
       <li> 1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
       <h2>Icing</h2>
       
<li>1 (16 ounce) package brown sugar</li>
<li>1 cup butter</li>
<li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
<li>⅔ cup evaporated milk</li>
<li>1 (16 ounce) package confectioners' sugar, sifted</li>
<li>2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<li> 1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour three 9-inch cake .<li>
   <li>2.  Make cake: Place white sugar and butter into a mixing bowl. Beat with an electric mixer on medium speed until light and fluffy. Add eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition.</li>
   <li> 3. Combine flour, baking powder, and salt in a separate bowl. Add flour mixture in batches, alternating with milk, beating batter briefly after each addition. Add vanilla extract; beat until batter makes ribbons when falling from the beaters. Divide batter among the prepared cake pans.</li>
   <li>  4. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Cool on a wire rack for 5 minutes. Run a table knife around the edges to loosen. Invert carefully onto a cooling rack. Let cool, about 30 minutes.</li>
   <li>5. Make icing: Combine brown sugar, butter, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir until brown sugar is dissolved, about 3 minutes. Add evaporated milk and continue stirring. Bring to a gentle boil and let bubble for about 4 minutes, stirring constantly to avoid sticking. Remove from heat and allow to cool, about 5 minutes.</li> 
   <li> 6. Mix confectioners' sugar and vanilla extract into brown sugar mixture using an electric mixer until icing caramelizes and thickens to the desired consistency.
    <li>7. Spread icing onto cooled cake layers. Stack layers; ice top and sides.</li>
